# General feedback:
Great milestone and an interesting idea, as it involves many different tools and concepts you acquired during the course.
Anyways, there are just a few points which lack clarity.
Please see detailed comments below.

## Abstract Well-written.
It gives a quick but efficient and detailed definition of clichés, the main focus of your work.

## Research questions
The research questions define the key aspects of your work, and the kind of relationships you want to investigate.
Anyway, there are some minor issues: Try to reformulate the third question, as it is not clear to me how clichés might be linked to hyperlinks.
Are you suggesting that, for a given page, its clichés should be included in hyperlinks? If this is the case, then you will end up including “bias” in the page, that might be something you would like to remove or mitigate.

## Proposed additional dataset 
The additional datasets you mentioned seem reasonable and useful, and it is also interesting to use ChatGPT to perform some kind of data augmentation.
However, be cautious that ChatGPT can hallucinate, so you will need some mechanism to be sure that your augmented data is noise and hallucination free.

## Methods
You gave a clear and detailed description of your work, and it is good you have started your preliminary analysis considering only one page but related to several other topics.
There are some minor issues I would like to point out: Retrieving clichés manually might make the whole pipeline unfeasible, and you might end up having a number of final observations which is not large enough to draw any statistically significant conclusion.
Augmenting the data (using one of the techniques you mentioned) is therefore suggested.
That said, in this case, you will first need to validate if your data augmentation method is reliable and works as intended on a small collection of randomly sampled articles, which you will assess manually.
The last bullet point you discussed is really interesting, as it perfectly represents the problem you described at the beginning of the whole description.
I think the choice of the classification model should work, but you might try something a bit more powerful in case it performs poorly.

## Timeline and organization within the team
Very detailed and reasonable.
Since you have a team of 5, I will suggest the following: One member to start setting up the data story infrastructure and also an initial sketch of the story sooner.
Please don’t leave this towards the last week, and use the last week only for fine-tuning.

## Question for TAs: 
I think ChatGPT would be enough, at least for a result which looks like a proof of concept.
Browsing the Internet does not allow you to make the whole procedure scalable and efficient.
However, as stated previously, be cautious that ChatGPT can hallucinate and even encode standard biases, so you will need some mechanism (e.g. manual inspection) to be sure that your augmented data is noise, hallucination, and bias free.

## Textual description quality:
Very Good, meaningful comments which guide the reader through the whole pipeline.
Nice plots! 
## Code quality:
Great, ample amount of comments! The code and repo are really well structured.
